      <h4 style="color:#477AB8;">THE PROVISO DIFFERENCE</h4>
        <p>There are several aspects related to the composition, the ethos and the values that makes us different.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4 style="color:#477AB8;">PERSONALIZED APPROACH</h4>
        <p>A résumé tells only a part of the story. We are not content matching a requirement to a résumé, since we understand that this approach leads to unpredictable results. For this reason, we seek to know and understand the individual behind résumé – their past experiences, their future aspirations, their gifts and their challenges. We feel it is our duty as human-being to honour one another for who we are rather than merely being concerned about who we need at a particular juncture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4 style="color:#477AB8;">INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS IN THE TEAM</h4>
        <p>Our team is a blend of recruitment professionals, and Finance and IT industry practitioners. We speak your language and understand your career path and can better relate to your career aspirations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4 style="color:#477AB8;">GROWTH THROUGH REFERRAL</h4>
        <p>It is a management strategy to only grow through referrals from existing clients – employers as well as hires. This forces us to focus more on client service than others, all through the relationship. We have thus been able to leverage this strategy to become different – become better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4 style="color:#477AB8;">VALUE</h4>
        <p>We have predicated our business on adding value. We earnestly strive to be of value to all our clients – the employers as well as the job-seekers. We have hedged all our bets on adding value – believing that this is one currency whose value does not depreciate no matter what the economic weather is. Going by our fast-paced growth, it seems our belief is not mistaken. These are the various driving factors behind our difference. How different? We invite to work with us and discover for yourselves.</p>
